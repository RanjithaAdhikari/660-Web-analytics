This is a GREAT spot. I've been here twice now and have been so pleased both times. It's a super tiny restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation if you can! The happy hour is AMAZING! I believe it's from 5-7p weekdays, and it includes drinks AND food ($8 margaritas and $8 for 2 chicken tacos, for example - the full HH menu is on their website).Things I have gotten and loved include the margarita and the Mayan cocktails, the short rib tacos, chicken tacos, and of course guacamole + chips. Yum! Portions are an adequate size. The staff is always so kind and hospitable. Come on in!
I came here for brunch - I loved this little place! Seats only 14 people and it was a cute whole-in-the-wall vibe. I also felt like I wasn't in NY...a quick vacation to Mexico?Ambience: 5-star - Restaurant is decorated in Mexican flag colors and Mexican artifacts. Loved it! It's very small, so get ready to squeeze tight. There's a 4 person outdoor patio and a bar and table area. Food: 4-star - loved the guacamole and the chilaquiles. It was so much food! I couldn't finish the chilaquiles. Guacamole was a bit too citrusy for my taste but my bf loved it. The chilaquiles is slightly spicy..be warned! It wasn't the BEST Mexican food I've had but it was still delicious. I would definitely recommend the place. Drinks: 3-star - I had the Bloody Maria - STRONG! Tequila flavor was a bit too strong for my taste. Service: 5-star - very sweet ladies who were extremely excited when I spoke in Spanish!If you want to feel like you're on vacation, go to La Contenta!
So it's a Saturday early evening and my friend messages me asking if I wanted to go for happy hour. In my head I think, "Happy hour? On a Saturday night? No such thing." And then she affirms me that there is, from 4-6. It's 5:32PM. There's no way we would make it in time. But surprise, we made it (we were on the Lower East Side). Now to the food.Pros:Food wise (based on the happy hour menu where everything, food and drinks, is roughly $8): My friend is a pescatarian so the menu is very catering to everyone (not much of the happy hour menu is meat based).Recommend: fish tacos, nachos, and torta. were my choices. Fish tacos were massive too - almost a little too big for the shell but I was not complaining. Nachos were quality where every chip has a little bit on it. Torta: so good that 3 hours later my friend is still raving about it.Cons:My only complaint about this restaurant is the size. It's a bit small (did the math and you can maybe seat 30 people total including the outside). The servers are attentive and friendly as well. TLDR: if you're looking for a happy hour on a Saturday and some quality mexican food, I recommend going here! P.S. Yes, there is free chips and salsa
Delicious food. Try the shrimp torta - it's incredible and a little different to your standard Mexican place. The Essex cocktail is nice and potent. The Mayan and beer cocktails also great. Bar tender was accommodating and lovely. We had the shrimp torta and queso - both delectable. Wasn't too busy 5.30 on a Friday. Cute atmosphere and a group celebrating a bday, all round good find and experience
This place is LES's not so secret Mexican joint. A small, unassuming restaurant from the outside, La Contenta has much more to offer than it looks. From fish tacos to gambas al ajillo, margarita to mirosa, La Contenta carries a simple menu that aims satisfy all of its clientele (unless you're vegetarian I suppose, but then why would you dine at a Mexican joint). It is even approved by my Latina amiga ("a real Mexican would enjoy my carne asada"). Aside from the delicious food, La Contenta remains one of the very few restaurants that still charges a reasonable price ($13 for all brunch plates and $7 for cocktail) in the gentrifying neighborhood. What is there not to like - good food, good vibe, and good people.
Went here for a happy hour on Saturday. It is a small place but the ambience was lovely and very welcoming. I tried a variety of drinks from the margaritas,to the Bloody Mary,to the gin infused drinks. They were all relatively strong but also tasty at the same time. The service was perfect and our bartender was vibrant and was always ready to refill our drinks if we needed it. Would definitely recommend that you come here if you are in the area and are looking for a happy Hour or trying to burn some time.
The service is exquisite,very fast and precise what you order.Enchiladas were very good and spicy as it should be,drinks,in this case cocktails were formidable exotic tasting,like being in Cancun.Definitevely willcome back very soon.
Sometimes you must have done seriously right in life to be blessed with Such good food places around you !! La contenta is one such cute place !! I totally totally love this place ! Went for a brunch on Saturday afternoon at 12:30 pm and so lucky we got a spot immediately !! Tiny little super cute restaurant which can host people upto 9 tables !! I believe people wait a lot here before they get a spot but u see that's what yummy places do to you !!!One of the best ever brunches and Mexican food I ve ever had !!! So bloody good food !!! Totally loved it ! Anything on the brunch menu is $13 and drinks are $7 !! The staff is so sweet !! We got sangrias and camarones al ajillo and chilaquiles with eggs (sunny side up))!! Highly recommend these so very yummy !!! And ended it with tres leches which was great !! Please do not miss this place must must try !! I'm going back again !! La contenta-please open up a restaurant at DC area ! I miss your food
This review is not based on their food, it's mainly on the service and the drinks.After brunch at a different place, I went here for some drinks (yes, daytime drinking!) with my husband and 3 friends. The place was very small and we sat outside (they have one table outside that fits about 5 people). It was packed and crowded inside the restaurant and it didn't seem like they take big parties because of the size of the place.We ordered some drinks (Mirosa, Sangria, Mojito and The Mayan), I was not a fan of the Mirosa but I took sips of the other drinks and they were delicious. The Mirosa was a Mimosa with a Mexican twist and the flavors were kind of off for me. Really liked their Mojito, refreshing and not too sweet, just all the right flavors. White Sangria was delicious but pretty strong for day time drinking lol.The waitress brought out chips and a salsa kinda dip and it was very good but they gave us very little chips and we had to keep asking for more. We also ordered one dish to munch on, The Chilaquiles, so yummy. It was chips with chicken and eggs and "Oaxaca" cheese and sauce, the whole thing was so good! It just melted in your mouth.Even though we didn't order food, it didn't diminish the kind of service and attention we got. Every one was kind and friendly. Our waitress, Heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Wonderful experience.
Great attentive service. Drinks were ok. Food was pk. Narrow room that lends out to an open al fresco front, located on a semi secluded side street spot. I would try again but not getting the 4-5 star reviews. Perhaps a slow weekday off peak hour had something to do with it.
A cozy, boozy spot for brunch! (Definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people)The bartender was great with a positive attitude, although I didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up. They have great Mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and "bloody marias" so I'll def have to order those next time.They give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too! But the star is DEFINITELY the CHILAQUILES. It immediately pulled at my heartstrings as a Californian and is undoubtedly one of my favorite brunch foods.The chips were crispy, evenly and fully coated with the sauce and the eggs on top were perfect. It didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! I was super full afterwards. My friend on the enchiladas which were also super good. The sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted.I feel like we waited for our food for a while...maybe like 25 minutes or so but I think they were a bit backed up so it's understandable!I definitely recommend coming here if you're tired of the standard egg benedict/mimosa brunch.
This is a real hole in the wall place! I met up with a friend visiting from London and our significant others. After a major delay on the f train, I was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door. Probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time. The drinks were delicious and I did like the Frida kalo mug. After the other two arrived (both, like me, via the slow moving f train) we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style. This gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer. Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche (which was extremely fresh) and the queso (which got pretty messy)which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table. I also enjoyed the fish tacos. I really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal. Our server was also so sweet!! This place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant. I would 100% come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu!
Good food. Very busy on a Saturday.Service can be spotty if you sit at the bar to eat. Couple that came in after me ordered were served, ate and left before I got my food.
The hubby, my nephew and I stopped on during happy hour. We sat at the bar, which is always fun. More space too! We each had the chicken tacos, which were amazing! The hubby had a beer. Service was great, as last time.
Cute spot with delicious food! Came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed. Although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar. We started with the guac (just do it!) and then got Chile Relleno and tacos. Service was great and everyone was friendly. Definitely all good vibes.Despite it being a tiny place, we were never ignored or left hanging. If you're on the LES and craving Mexican food, please make a stop here.
This is such a cute and small spot to grab great Mexican food in the LES! I stopped by for early dinner on a Sunday with a friend which also happened to be happy hour which was great! We ordered the fish tacos, queso and a side of rice & beans. I wouldn't suggest the queso but the fish tacos were AMAZING! I could definitely see myself coming back again!
This place is super small, think living room sized, but it's very cute and colorful and has a nicely stocked bar. Excellent cocktails and amazing food selections.
Super fun small loud bar on the LES. Great happy hour and margaritas.
HH menu is great. concise and good portions. Shrimp slider was really good. Margaritas small but good. smaller space but not cramped - sat at booth at bar.
The food and drinks here aren't too bad. The staff is charming, but not as attentive as they could be. But the place is the size of a shoebox and isn't comfortable imho. If I go back, I would go on a slow day. I like to eat and be able to move around, not contract my limbs whilst doing so.

This is such a cute and small spot to grab great Mexican food in the LES! I stopped by for early dinner on a Sunday with a friend which also happened to be happy hour which was great! We ordered the fish tacos, queso and a side of rice & beans. I wouldn't suggest the queso but the fish tacos were AMAZING! I could definitely see myself coming back again!
This place is super small, think living room sized, but it's very cute and colorful and has a nicely stocked bar. Excellent cocktails and amazing food selections.
Super fun small loud bar on the LES. Great happy hour and margaritas.
HH menu is great. concise and good portions. Shrimp slider was really good. Margaritas small but good. smaller space but not cramped - sat at booth at bar.
The food and drinks here aren't too bad. The staff is charming, but not as attentive as they could be. But the place is the size of a shoebox and isn't comfortable imho. If I go back, I would go on a slow day. I like to eat and be able to move around, not contract my limbs whilst doing so.
This is a GREAT spot. I've been here twice now and have been so pleased both times. It's a super tiny restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation if you can! The happy hour is AMAZING! I believe it's from 5-7p weekdays, and it includes drinks AND food ($8 margaritas and $8 for 2 chicken tacos, for example - the full HH menu is on their website).Things I have gotten and loved include the margarita and the Mayan cocktails, the short rib tacos, chicken tacos, and of course guacamole + chips. Yum! Portions are an adequate size. The staff is always so kind and hospitable. Come on in!
I came here for brunch - I loved this little place! Seats only 14 people and it was a cute whole-in-the-wall vibe. I also felt like I wasn't in NY...a quick vacation to Mexico?Ambience: 5-star - Restaurant is decorated in Mexican flag colors and Mexican artifacts. Loved it! It's very small, so get ready to squeeze tight. There's a 4 person outdoor patio and a bar and table area. Food: 4-star - loved the guacamole and the chilaquiles. It was so much food! I couldn't finish the chilaquiles. Guacamole was a bit too citrusy for my taste but my bf loved it. The chilaquiles is slightly spicy..be warned! It wasn't the BEST Mexican food I've had but it was still delicious. I would definitely recommend the place. Drinks: 3-star - I had the Bloody Maria - STRONG! Tequila flavor was a bit too strong for my taste. Service: 5-star - very sweet ladies who were extremely excited when I spoke in Spanish!If you want to feel like you're on vacation, go to La Contenta!
So it's a Saturday early evening and my friend messages me asking if I wanted to go for happy hour. In my head I think, "Happy hour? On a Saturday night? No such thing." And then she affirms me that there is, from 4-6. It's 5:32PM. There's no way we would make it in time. But surprise, we made it (we were on the Lower East Side). Now to the food.Pros:Food wise (based on the happy hour menu where everything, food and drinks, is roughly $8): My friend is a pescatarian so the menu is very catering to everyone (not much of the happy hour menu is meat based).Recommend: fish tacos, nachos, and torta. were my choices. Fish tacos were massive too - almost a little too big for the shell but I was not complaining. Nachos were quality where every chip has a little bit on it. Torta: so good that 3 hours later my friend is still raving about it.Cons:My only complaint about this restaurant is the size. It's a bit small (did the math and you can maybe seat 30 people total including the outside). The servers are attentive and friendly as well. TLDR: if you're looking for a happy hour on a Saturday and some quality mexican food, I recommend going here! P.S. Yes, there is free chips and salsa
Delicious food. Try the shrimp torta - it's incredible and a little different to your standard Mexican place. The Essex cocktail is nice and potent. The Mayan and beer cocktails also great. Bar tender was accommodating and lovely. We had the shrimp torta and queso - both delectable. Wasn't too busy 5.30 on a Friday. Cute atmosphere and a group celebrating a bday, all round good find and experience
This place is LES's not so secret Mexican joint. A small, unassuming restaurant from the outside, La Contenta has much more to offer than it looks. From fish tacos to gambas al ajillo, margarita to mirosa, La Contenta carries a simple menu that aims satisfy all of its clientele (unless you're vegetarian I suppose, but then why would you dine at a Mexican joint). It is even approved by my Latina amiga ("a real Mexican would enjoy my carne asada"). Aside from the delicious food, La Contenta remains one of the very few restaurants that still charges a reasonable price ($13 for all brunch plates and $7 for cocktail) in the gentrifying neighborhood. What is there not to like - good food, good vibe, and good people.
Went here for a happy hour on Saturday. It is a small place but the ambience was lovely and very welcoming. I tried a variety of drinks from the margaritas,to the Bloody Mary,to the gin infused drinks. They were all relatively strong but also tasty at the same time. The service was perfect and our bartender was vibrant and was always ready to refill our drinks if we needed it. Would definitely recommend that you come here if you are in the area and are looking for a happy Hour or trying to burn some time.
The service is exquisite,very fast and precise what you order.Enchiladas were very good and spicy as it should be,drinks,in this case cocktails were formidable exotic tasting,like being in Cancun.Definitevely willcome back very soon.
Sometimes you must have done seriously right in life to be blessed with Such good food places around you !! La contenta is one such cute place !! I totally totally love this place ! Went for a brunch on Saturday afternoon at 12:30 pm and so lucky we got a spot immediately !! Tiny little super cute restaurant which can host people upto 9 tables !! I believe people wait a lot here before they get a spot but u see that's what yummy places do to you !!!One of the best ever brunches and Mexican food I ve ever had !!! So bloody good food !!! Totally loved it ! Anything on the brunch menu is $13 and drinks are $7 !! The staff is so sweet !! We got sangrias and camarones al ajillo and chilaquiles with eggs (sunny side up))!! Highly recommend these so very yummy !!! And ended it with tres leches which was great !! Please do not miss this place must must try !! I'm going back again !! La contenta-please open up a restaurant at DC area ! I miss your food
This review is not based on their food, it's mainly on the service and the drinks.After brunch at a different place, I went here for some drinks (yes, daytime drinking!) with my husband and 3 friends. The place was very small and we sat outside (they have one table outside that fits about 5 people). It was packed and crowded inside the restaurant and it didn't seem like they take big parties because of the size of the place.We ordered some drinks (Mirosa, Sangria, Mojito and The Mayan), I was not a fan of the Mirosa but I took sips of the other drinks and they were delicious. The Mirosa was a Mimosa with a Mexican twist and the flavors were kind of off for me. Really liked their Mojito, refreshing and not too sweet, just all the right flavors. White Sangria was delicious but pretty strong for day time drinking lol.The waitress brought out chips and a salsa kinda dip and it was very good but they gave us very little chips and we had to keep asking for more. We also ordered one dish to munch on, The Chilaquiles, so yummy. It was chips with chicken and eggs and "Oaxaca" cheese and sauce, the whole thing was so good! It just melted in your mouth.Even though we didn't order food, it didn't diminish the kind of service and attention we got. Every one was kind and friendly. Our waitress, Heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Wonderful experience.
Great attentive service. Drinks were ok. Food was pk. Narrow room that lends out to an open al fresco front, located on a semi secluded side street spot. I would try again but not getting the 4-5 star reviews. Perhaps a slow weekday off peak hour had something to do with it.
A cozy, boozy spot for brunch! (Definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people)The bartender was great with a positive attitude, although I didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up. They have great Mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and "bloody marias" so I'll def have to order those next time.They give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too! But the star is DEFINITELY the CHILAQUILES. It immediately pulled at my heartstrings as a Californian and is undoubtedly one of my favorite brunch foods.The chips were crispy, evenly and fully coated with the sauce and the eggs on top were perfect. It didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! I was super full afterwards. My friend on the enchiladas which were also super good. The sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted.I feel like we waited for our food for a while...maybe like 25 minutes or so but I think they were a bit backed up so it's understandable!I definitely recommend coming here if you're tired of the standard egg benedict/mimosa brunch.
This is a real hole in the wall place! I met up with a friend visiting from London and our significant others. After a major delay on the f train, I was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door. Probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time. The drinks were delicious and I did like the Frida kalo mug. After the other two arrived (both, like me, via the slow moving f train) we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style. This gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer. Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche (which was extremely fresh) and the queso (which got pretty messy)which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table. I also enjoyed the fish tacos. I really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal. Our server was also so sweet!! This place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant. I would 100% come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu!
Good food. Very busy on a Saturday.Service can be spotty if you sit at the bar to eat. Couple that came in after me ordered were served, ate and left before I got my food.
The hubby, my nephew and I stopped on during happy hour. We sat at the bar, which is always fun. More space too! We each had the chicken tacos, which were amazing! The hubby had a beer. Service was great, as last time.
Cute spot with delicious food! Came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed. Although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar. We started with the guac (just do it!) and then got Chile Relleno and tacos. Service was great and everyone was friendly. Definitely all good vibes.Despite it being a tiny place, we were never ignored or left hanging. If you're on the LES and craving Mexican food, please make a stop here.

I also enjoyed the fish tacos. I really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal. Our server was also so sweet!! This place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant. I would 100% come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu!
Good food. Very busy on a Saturday.Service can be spotty if you sit at the bar to eat. Couple that came in after me ordered were served, ate and left before I got my food.
The hubby, my nephew and I stopped on during happy hour. We sat at the bar, which is always fun. More space too! We each had the chicken tacos, which were amazing! The hubby had a beer. Service was great, as last time.
Cute spot with delicious food! Came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed. Although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar. We started with the guac (just do it!) and then got Chile Relleno and tacos. Service was great and everyone was friendly. Definitely all good vibes.Despite it being a tiny place, we were never ignored or left hanging. If you're on the LES and craving Mexican food, please make a stop here.
This is such a cute and small spot to grab great Mexican food in the LES! I stopped by for early dinner on a Sunday with a friend which also happened to be happy hour which was great! We ordered the fish tacos, queso and a side of rice & beans. I wouldn't suggest the queso but the fish tacos were AMAZING! I could definitely see myself coming back again!
This place is super small, think living room sized, but it's very cute and colorful and has a nicely stocked bar. Excellent cocktails and amazing food selections.
Super fun small loud bar on the LES. Great happy hour and margaritas.
HH menu is great. concise and good portions. Shrimp slider was really good. Margaritas small but good. smaller space but not cramped - sat at booth at bar.
The food and drinks here aren't too bad. The staff is charming, but not as attentive as they could be. But the place is the size of a shoebox and isn't comfortable imho. If I go back, I would go on a slow day. I like to eat and be able to move around, not contract my limbs whilst doing so.
This is a GREAT spot. I've been here twice now and have been so pleased both times. It's a super tiny restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation if you can! The happy hour is AMAZING! I believe it's from 5-7p weekdays, and it includes drinks AND food ($8 margaritas and $8 for 2 chicken tacos, for example - the full HH menu is on their website).Things I have gotten and loved include the margarita and the Mayan cocktails, the short rib tacos, chicken tacos, and of course guacamole + chips. Yum! Portions are an adequate size. The staff is always so kind and hospitable. Come on in!
I came here for brunch - I loved this little place! Seats only 14 people and it was a cute whole-in-the-wall vibe. I also felt like I wasn't in NY...a quick vacation to Mexico?Ambience: 5-star - Restaurant is decorated in Mexican flag colors and Mexican artifacts. Loved it! It's very small, so get ready to squeeze tight. There's a 4 person outdoor patio and a bar and table area. Food: 4-star - loved the guacamole and the chilaquiles. It was so much food! I couldn't finish the chilaquiles. Guacamole was a bit too citrusy for my taste but my bf loved it. The chilaquiles is slightly spicy..be warned! It wasn't the BEST Mexican food I've had but it was still delicious. I would definitely recommend the place. Drinks: 3-star - I had the Bloody Maria - STRONG! Tequila flavor was a bit too strong for my taste. Service: 5-star - very sweet ladies who were extremely excited when I spoke in Spanish!If you want to feel like you're on vacation, go to La Contenta!
So it's a Saturday early evening and my friend messages me asking if I wanted to go for happy hour. In my head I think, "Happy hour? On a Saturday night? No such thing." And then she affirms me that there is, from 4-6. It's 5:32PM. There's no way we would make it in time. But surprise, we made it (we were on the Lower East Side). Now to the food.Pros:Food wise (based on the happy hour menu where everything, food and drinks, is roughly $8): My friend is a pescatarian so the menu is very catering to everyone (not much of the happy hour menu is meat based).Recommend: fish tacos, nachos, and torta. were my choices. Fish tacos were massive too - almost a little too big for the shell but I was not complaining. Nachos were quality where every chip has a little bit on it. Torta: so good that 3 hours later my friend is still raving about it.Cons:My only complaint about this restaurant is the size. It's a bit small (did the math and you can maybe seat 30 people total including the outside). The servers are attentive and friendly as well. TLDR: if you're looking for a happy hour on a Saturday and some quality mexican food, I recommend going here! P.S. Yes, there is free chips and salsa
Delicious food. Try the shrimp torta - it's incredible and a little different to your standard Mexican place. The Essex cocktail is nice and potent. The Mayan and beer cocktails also great. Bar tender was accommodating and lovely. We had the shrimp torta and queso - both delectable. Wasn't too busy 5.30 on a Friday. Cute atmosphere and a group celebrating a bday, all round good find and experience
This place is LES's not so secret Mexican joint. A small, unassuming restaurant from the outside, La Contenta has much more to offer than it looks. From fish tacos to gambas al ajillo, margarita to mirosa, La Contenta carries a simple menu that aims satisfy all of its clientele (unless you're vegetarian I suppose, but then why would you dine at a Mexican joint). It is even approved by my Latina amiga ("a real Mexican would enjoy my carne asada"). Aside from the delicious food, La Contenta remains one of the very few restaurants that still charges a reasonable price ($13 for all brunch plates and $7 for cocktail) in the gentrifying neighborhood. What is there not to like - good food, good vibe, and good people.
Went here for a happy hour on Saturday. It is a small place but the ambience was lovely and very welcoming. I tried a variety of drinks from the margaritas,to the Bloody Mary,to the gin infused drinks. They were all relatively strong but also tasty at the same time. The service was perfect and our bartender was vibrant and was always ready to refill our drinks if we needed it. Would definitely recommend that you come here if you are in the area and are looking for a happy Hour or trying to burn some time.
The service is exquisite,very fast and precise what you order.Enchiladas were very good and spicy as it should be,drinks,in this case cocktails were formidable exotic tasting,like being in Cancun.Definitevely willcome back very soon.
Sometimes you must have done seriously right in life to be blessed with Such good food places around you !! La contenta is one such cute place !! I totally totally love this place ! Went for a brunch on Saturday afternoon at 12:30 pm and so lucky we got a spot immediately !! Tiny little super cute restaurant which can host people upto 9 tables !! I believe people wait a lot here before they get a spot but u see that's what yummy places do to you !!!One of the best ever brunches and Mexican food I ve ever had !!! So bloody good food !!! Totally loved it ! Anything on the brunch menu is $13 and drinks are $7 !! The staff is so sweet !! We got sangrias and camarones al ajillo and chilaquiles with eggs (sunny side up))!! Highly recommend these so very yummy !!! And ended it with tres leches which was great !! Please do not miss this place must must try !! I'm going back again !! La contenta-please open up a restaurant at DC area ! I miss your food
This review is not based on their food, it's mainly on the service and the drinks.After brunch at a different place, I went here for some drinks (yes, daytime drinking!) with my husband and 3 friends. The place was very small and we sat outside (they have one table outside that fits about 5 people). It was packed and crowded inside the restaurant and it didn't seem like they take big parties because of the size of the place.We ordered some drinks (Mirosa, Sangria, Mojito and The Mayan), I was not a fan of the Mirosa but I took sips of the other drinks and they were delicious. The Mirosa was a Mimosa with a Mexican twist and the flavors were kind of off for me. Really liked their Mojito, refreshing and not too sweet, just all the right flavors. White Sangria was delicious but pretty strong for day time drinking lol.The waitress brought out chips and a salsa kinda dip and it was very good but they gave us very little chips and we had to keep asking for more. We also ordered one dish to munch on, The Chilaquiles, so yummy. It was chips with chicken and eggs and "Oaxaca" cheese and sauce, the whole thing was so good! It just melted in your mouth.Even though we didn't order food, it didn't diminish the kind of service and attention we got. Every one was kind and friendly. Our waitress, Heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Wonderful experience.
Great attentive service. Drinks were ok. Food was pk. Narrow room that lends out to an open al fresco front, located on a semi secluded side street spot. I would try again but not getting the 4-5 star reviews. Perhaps a slow weekday off peak hour had something to do with it.
A cozy, boozy spot for brunch! (Definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people)The bartender was great with a positive attitude, although I didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up. They have great Mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and "bloody marias" so I'll def have to order those next time.They give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too! But the star is DEFINITELY the CHILAQUILES. It immediately pulled at my heartstrings as a Californian and is undoubtedly one of my favorite brunch foods.The chips were crispy, evenly and fully coated with the sauce and the eggs on top were perfect. It didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! I was super full afterwards. My friend on the enchiladas which were also super good. The sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted.I feel like we waited for our food for a while...maybe like 25 minutes or so but I think they were a bit backed up so it's understandable!I definitely recommend coming here if you're tired of the standard egg benedict/mimosa brunch.
This is a real hole in the wall place! I met up with a friend visiting from London and our significant others. After a major delay on the f train, I was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door. Probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time. The drinks were delicious and I did like the Frida kalo mug. After the other two arrived (both, like me, via the slow moving f train) we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style. This gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer. Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche (which was extremely fresh) and the queso (which got pretty messy)which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table. I also enjoyed the fish tacos. I really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal.

It didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! I was super full afterwards. My friend on the enchiladas which were also super good. The sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted.I feel like we waited for our food for a while...maybe like 25 minutes or so but I think they were a bit backed up so it's understandable!I definitely recommend coming here if you're tired of the standard egg benedict/mimosa brunch.
This is a real hole in the wall place! I met up with a friend visiting from London and our significant others. After a major delay on the f train, I was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door. Probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time. The drinks were delicious and I did like the Frida kalo mug. After the other two arrived (both, like me, via the slow moving f train) we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style. This gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer. Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche (which was extremely fresh) and the queso (which got pretty messy)which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table. I also enjoyed the fish tacos. I really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal. Our server was also so sweet!! This place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant. I would 100% come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu!
Good food. Very busy on a Saturday.Service can be spotty if you sit at the bar to eat. Couple that came in after me ordered were served, ate and left before I got my food.
The hubby, my nephew and I stopped on during happy hour. We sat at the bar, which is always fun. More space too! We each had the chicken tacos, which were amazing! The hubby had a beer. Service was great, as last time.
Cute spot with delicious food! Came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed. Although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar. We started with the guac (just do it!) and then got Chile Relleno and tacos. Service was great and everyone was friendly. Definitely all good vibes.Despite it being a tiny place, we were never ignored or left hanging. If you're on the LES and craving Mexican food, please make a stop here.
This is such a cute and small spot to grab great Mexican food in the LES! I stopped by for early dinner on a Sunday with a friend which also happened to be happy hour which was great! We ordered the fish tacos, queso and a side of rice & beans. I wouldn't suggest the queso but the fish tacos were AMAZING! I could definitely see myself coming back again!
This place is super small, think living room sized, but it's very cute and colorful and has a nicely stocked bar. Excellent cocktails and amazing food selections.
Super fun small loud bar on the LES. Great happy hour and margaritas.
HH menu is great. concise and good portions. Shrimp slider was really good. Margaritas small but good. smaller space but not cramped - sat at booth at bar.
The food and drinks here aren't too bad. The staff is charming, but not as attentive as they could be. But the place is the size of a shoebox and isn't comfortable imho. If I go back, I would go on a slow day. I like to eat and be able to move around, not contract my limbs whilst doing so.
This is a GREAT spot. I've been here twice now and have been so pleased both times. It's a super tiny restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation if you can! The happy hour is AMAZING! I believe it's from 5-7p weekdays, and it includes drinks AND food ($8 margaritas and $8 for 2 chicken tacos, for example - the full HH menu is on their website).Things I have gotten and loved include the margarita and the Mayan cocktails, the short rib tacos, chicken tacos, and of course guacamole + chips. Yum! Portions are an adequate size. The staff is always so kind and hospitable. Come on in!
I came here for brunch - I loved this little place! Seats only 14 people and it was a cute whole-in-the-wall vibe. I also felt like I wasn't in NY...a quick vacation to Mexico?Ambience: 5-star - Restaurant is decorated in Mexican flag colors and Mexican artifacts. Loved it! It's very small, so get ready to squeeze tight. There's a 4 person outdoor patio and a bar and table area. Food: 4-star - loved the guacamole and the chilaquiles. It was so much food! I couldn't finish the chilaquiles. Guacamole was a bit too citrusy for my taste but my bf loved it. The chilaquiles is slightly spicy..be warned! It wasn't the BEST Mexican food I've had but it was still delicious. I would definitely recommend the place. Drinks: 3-star - I had the Bloody Maria - STRONG! Tequila flavor was a bit too strong for my taste. Service: 5-star - very sweet ladies who were extremely excited when I spoke in Spanish!If you want to feel like you're on vacation, go to La Contenta!
So it's a Saturday early evening and my friend messages me asking if I wanted to go for happy hour. In my head I think, "Happy hour? On a Saturday night? No such thing." And then she affirms me that there is, from 4-6. It's 5:32PM. There's no way we would make it in time. But surprise, we made it (we were on the Lower East Side). Now to the food.Pros:Food wise (based on the happy hour menu where everything, food and drinks, is roughly $8): My friend is a pescatarian so the menu is very catering to everyone (not much of the happy hour menu is meat based).Recommend: fish tacos, nachos, and torta. were my choices. Fish tacos were massive too - almost a little too big for the shell but I was not complaining. Nachos were quality where every chip has a little bit on it. Torta: so good that 3 hours later my friend is still raving about it.Cons:My only complaint about this restaurant is the size. It's a bit small (did the math and you can maybe seat 30 people total including the outside). The servers are attentive and friendly as well. TLDR: if you're looking for a happy hour on a Saturday and some quality mexican food, I recommend going here! P.S. Yes, there is free chips and salsa
Delicious food. Try the shrimp torta - it's incredible and a little different to your standard Mexican place. The Essex cocktail is nice and potent. The Mayan and beer cocktails also great. Bar tender was accommodating and lovely. We had the shrimp torta and queso - both delectable. Wasn't too busy 5.30 on a Friday. Cute atmosphere and a group celebrating a bday, all round good find and experience
This place is LES's not so secret Mexican joint. A small, unassuming restaurant from the outside, La Contenta has much more to offer than it looks. From fish tacos to gambas al ajillo, margarita to mirosa, La Contenta carries a simple menu that aims satisfy all of its clientele (unless you're vegetarian I suppose, but then why would you dine at a Mexican joint). It is even approved by my Latina amiga ("a real Mexican would enjoy my carne asada"). Aside from the delicious food, La Contenta remains one of the very few restaurants that still charges a reasonable price ($13 for all brunch plates and $7 for cocktail) in the gentrifying neighborhood. What is there not to like - good food, good vibe, and good people.
Went here for a happy hour on Saturday. It is a small place but the ambience was lovely and very welcoming. I tried a variety of drinks from the margaritas,to the Bloody Mary,to the gin infused drinks. They were all relatively strong but also tasty at the same time. The service was perfect and our bartender was vibrant and was always ready to refill our drinks if we needed it. Would definitely recommend that you come here if you are in the area and are looking for a happy Hour or trying to burn some time.
The service is exquisite,very fast and precise what you order.Enchiladas were very good and spicy as it should be,drinks,in this case cocktails were formidable exotic tasting,like being in Cancun.Definitevely willcome back very soon.
Sometimes you must have done seriously right in life to be blessed with Such good food places around you !! La contenta is one such cute place !! I totally totally love this place ! Went for a brunch on Saturday afternoon at 12:30 pm and so lucky we got a spot immediately !! Tiny little super cute restaurant which can host people upto 9 tables !! I believe people wait a lot here before they get a spot but u see that's what yummy places do to you !!!One of the best ever brunches and Mexican food I ve ever had !!! So bloody good food !!! Totally loved it ! Anything on the brunch menu is $13 and drinks are $7 !! The staff is so sweet !! We got sangrias and camarones al ajillo and chilaquiles with eggs (sunny side up))!! Highly recommend these so very yummy !!! And ended it with tres leches which was great !! Please do not miss this place must must try !! I'm going back again !! La contenta-please open up a restaurant at DC area ! I miss your food
This review is not based on their food, it's mainly on the service and the drinks.After brunch at a different place, I went here for some drinks (yes, daytime drinking!) with my husband and 3 friends. The place was very small and we sat outside (they have one table outside that fits about 5 people). It was packed and crowded inside the restaurant and it didn't seem like they take big parties because of the size of the place.We ordered some drinks (Mirosa, Sangria, Mojito and The Mayan), I was not a fan of the Mirosa but I took sips of the other drinks and they were delicious. The Mirosa was a Mimosa with a Mexican twist and the flavors were kind of off for me. Really liked their Mojito, refreshing and not too sweet, just all the right flavors. White Sangria was delicious but pretty strong for day time drinking lol.The waitress brought out chips and a salsa kinda dip and it was very good but they gave us very little chips and we had to keep asking for more. We also ordered one dish to munch on, The Chilaquiles, so yummy. It was chips with chicken and eggs and "Oaxaca" cheese and sauce, the whole thing was so good! It just melted in your mouth.Even though we didn't order food, it didn't diminish the kind of service and attention we got. Every one was kind and friendly. Our waitress, Heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Wonderful experience.
Great attentive service. Drinks were ok. Food was pk. Narrow room that lends out to an open al fresco front, located on a semi secluded side street spot. I would try again but not getting the 4-5 star reviews. Perhaps a slow weekday off peak hour had something to do with it.
A cozy, boozy spot for brunch! (Definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people)The bartender was great with a positive attitude, although I didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up. They have great Mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and "bloody marias" so I'll def have to order those next time.They give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too!

It just melted in your mouth.Even though we didn't order food, it didn't diminish the kind of service and attention we got. Every one was kind and friendly. Our waitress, Heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Wonderful experience.
Great attentive service. Drinks were ok. Food was pk. Narrow room that lends out to an open al fresco front, located on a semi secluded side street spot. I would try again but not getting the 4-5 star reviews. Perhaps a slow weekday off peak hour had something to do with it.
A cozy, boozy spot for brunch! (Definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people)The bartender was great with a positive attitude, although I didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up. They have great Mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and "bloody marias" so I'll def have to order those next time.They give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too! But the star is DEFINITELY the CHILAQUILES. It immediately pulled at my heartstrings as a Californian and is undoubtedly one of my favorite brunch foods.The chips were crispy, evenly and fully coated with the sauce and the eggs on top were perfect. It didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! I was super full afterwards. My friend on the enchiladas which were also super good. The sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted.I feel like we waited for our food for a while...maybe like 25 minutes or so but I think they were a bit backed up so it's understandable!I definitely recommend coming here if you're tired of the standard egg benedict/mimosa brunch.
This is a real hole in the wall place! I met up with a friend visiting from London and our significant others. After a major delay on the f train, I was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door. Probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time. The drinks were delicious and I did like the Frida kalo mug. After the other two arrived (both, like me, via the slow moving f train) we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style. This gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer. Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche (which was extremely fresh) and the queso (which got pretty messy)which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table. I also enjoyed the fish tacos. I really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal. Our server was also so sweet!! This place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant. I would 100% come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu!
Good food. Very busy on a Saturday.Service can be spotty if you sit at the bar to eat. Couple that came in after me ordered were served, ate and left before I got my food.
The hubby, my nephew and I stopped on during happy hour. We sat at the bar, which is always fun. More space too! We each had the chicken tacos, which were amazing! The hubby had a beer. Service was great, as last time.
Cute spot with delicious food! Came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed. Although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar. We started with the guac (just do it!) and then got Chile Relleno and tacos. Service was great and everyone was friendly. Definitely all good vibes.Despite it being a tiny place, we were never ignored or left hanging. If you're on the LES and craving Mexican food, please make a stop here.
This is such a cute and small spot to grab great Mexican food in the LES! I stopped by for early dinner on a Sunday with a friend which also happened to be happy hour which was great! We ordered the fish tacos, queso and a side of rice & beans. I wouldn't suggest the queso but the fish tacos were AMAZING! I could definitely see myself coming back again!
This place is super small, think living room sized, but it's very cute and colorful and has a nicely stocked bar. Excellent cocktails and amazing food selections.
Super fun small loud bar on the LES. Great happy hour and margaritas.
HH menu is great. concise and good portions. Shrimp slider was really good. Margaritas small but good. smaller space but not cramped - sat at booth at bar.
The food and drinks here aren't too bad. The staff is charming, but not as attentive as they could be. But the place is the size of a shoebox and isn't comfortable imho. If I go back, I would go on a slow day. I like to eat and be able to move around, not contract my limbs whilst doing so.
This is a GREAT spot. I've been here twice now and have been so pleased both times. It's a super tiny restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation if you can! The happy hour is AMAZING! I believe it's from 5-7p weekdays, and it includes drinks AND food ($8 margaritas and $8 for 2 chicken tacos, for example - the full HH menu is on their website).Things I have gotten and loved include the margarita and the Mayan cocktails, the short rib tacos, chicken tacos, and of course guacamole + chips. Yum! Portions are an adequate size. The staff is always so kind and hospitable. Come on in!
I came here for brunch - I loved this little place! Seats only 14 people and it was a cute whole-in-the-wall vibe. I also felt like I wasn't in NY...a quick vacation to Mexico?Ambience: 5-star - Restaurant is decorated in Mexican flag colors and Mexican artifacts. Loved it! It's very small, so get ready to squeeze tight. There's a 4 person outdoor patio and a bar and table area. Food: 4-star - loved the guacamole and the chilaquiles. It was so much food! I couldn't finish the chilaquiles. Guacamole was a bit too citrusy for my taste but my bf loved it. The chilaquiles is slightly spicy..be warned! It wasn't the BEST Mexican food I've had but it was still delicious. I would definitely recommend the place. Drinks: 3-star - I had the Bloody Maria - STRONG! Tequila flavor was a bit too strong for my taste. Service: 5-star - very sweet ladies who were extremely excited when I spoke in Spanish!If you want to feel like you're on vacation, go to La Contenta!
So it's a Saturday early evening and my friend messages me asking if I wanted to go for happy hour. In my head I think, "Happy hour? On a Saturday night? No such thing." And then she affirms me that there is, from 4-6. It's 5:32PM. There's no way we would make it in time. But surprise, we made it (we were on the Lower East Side). Now to the food.Pros:Food wise (based on the happy hour menu where everything, food and drinks, is roughly $8): My friend is a pescatarian so the menu is very catering to everyone (not much of the happy hour menu is meat based).Recommend: fish tacos, nachos, and torta. were my choices. Fish tacos were massive too - almost a little too big for the shell but I was not complaining. Nachos were quality where every chip has a little bit on it. Torta: so good that 3 hours later my friend is still raving about it.Cons:My only complaint about this restaurant is the size. It's a bit small (did the math and you can maybe seat 30 people total including the outside). The servers are attentive and friendly as well. TLDR: if you're looking for a happy hour on a Saturday and some quality mexican food, I recommend going here! P.S. Yes, there is free chips and salsa
Delicious food. Try the shrimp torta - it's incredible and a little different to your standard Mexican place. The Essex cocktail is nice and potent. The Mayan and beer cocktails also great. Bar tender was accommodating and lovely. We had the shrimp torta and queso - both delectable. Wasn't too busy 5.30 on a Friday. Cute atmosphere and a group celebrating a bday, all round good find and experience
This place is LES's not so secret Mexican joint. A small, unassuming restaurant from the outside, La Contenta has much more to offer than it looks. From fish tacos to gambas al ajillo, margarita to mirosa, La Contenta carries a simple menu that aims satisfy all of its clientele (unless you're vegetarian I suppose, but then why would you dine at a Mexican joint). It is even approved by my Latina amiga ("a real Mexican would enjoy my carne asada"). Aside from the delicious food, La Contenta remains one of the very few restaurants that still charges a reasonable price ($13 for all brunch plates and $7 for cocktail) in the gentrifying neighborhood. What is there not to like - good food, good vibe, and good people.
Went here for a happy hour on Saturday. It is a small place but the ambience was lovely and very welcoming. I tried a variety of drinks from the margaritas,to the Bloody Mary,to the gin infused drinks. They were all relatively strong but also tasty at the same time. The service was perfect and our bartender was vibrant and was always ready to refill our drinks if we needed it. Would definitely recommend that you come here if you are in the area and are looking for a happy Hour or trying to burn some time.
The service is exquisite,very fast and precise what you order.Enchiladas were very good and spicy as it should be,drinks,in this case cocktails were formidable exotic tasting,like being in Cancun.Definitevely willcome back very soon.
Sometimes you must have done seriously right in life to be blessed with Such good food places around you !! La contenta is one such cute place !! I totally totally love this place ! Went for a brunch on Saturday afternoon at 12:30 pm and so lucky we got a spot immediately !! Tiny little super cute restaurant which can host people upto 9 tables !! I believe people wait a lot here before they get a spot but u see that's what yummy places do to you !!!One of the best ever brunches and Mexican food I ve ever had !!! So bloody good food !!! Totally loved it ! Anything on the brunch menu is $13 and drinks are $7 !! The staff is so sweet !! We got sangrias and camarones al ajillo and chilaquiles with eggs (sunny side up))!! Highly recommend these so very yummy !!! And ended it with tres leches which was great !! Please do not miss this place must must try !! I'm going back again !! La contenta-please open up a restaurant at DC area ! I miss your food
This review is not based on their food, it's mainly on the service and the drinks.After brunch at a different place, I went here for some drinks (yes, daytime drinking!) with my husband and 3 friends. The place was very small and we sat outside (they have one table outside that fits about 5 people). It was packed and crowded inside the restaurant and it didn't seem like they take big parties because of the size of the place.We ordered some drinks (Mirosa, Sangria, Mojito and The Mayan), I was not a fan of the Mirosa but I took sips of the other drinks and they were delicious. The Mirosa was a Mimosa with a Mexican twist and the flavors were kind of off for me. Really liked their Mojito, refreshing and not too sweet, just all the right flavors. White Sangria was delicious but pretty strong for day time drinking lol.The waitress brought out chips and a salsa kinda dip and it was very good but they gave us very little chips and we had to keep asking for more.

This review is not based on their food, it's mainly on the service and the drinks.After brunch at a different place, I went here for some drinks (yes, daytime drinking!) with my husband and 3 friends. The place was very small and we sat outside (they have one table outside that fits about 5 people). It was packed and crowded inside the restaurant and it didn't seem like they take big parties because of the size of the place.We ordered some drinks (Mirosa, Sangria, Mojito and The Mayan), I was not a fan of the Mirosa but I took sips of the other drinks and they were delicious. The Mirosa was a Mimosa with a Mexican twist and the flavors were kind of off for me. Really liked their Mojito, refreshing and not too sweet, just all the right flavors. White Sangria was delicious but pretty strong for day time drinking lol.The waitress brought out chips and a salsa kinda dip and it was very good but they gave us very little chips and we had to keep asking for more. We also ordered one dish to munch on, The Chilaquiles, so yummy. It was chips with chicken and eggs and "Oaxaca" cheese and sauce, the whole thing was so good! It just melted in your mouth.Even though we didn't order food, it didn't diminish the kind of service and attention we got. Every one was kind and friendly. Our waitress, Heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable. Wonderful experience.
Great attentive service. Drinks were ok. Food was pk. Narrow room that lends out to an open al fresco front, located on a semi secluded side street spot. I would try again but not getting the 4-5 star reviews. Perhaps a slow weekday off peak hour had something to do with it.
A cozy, boozy spot for brunch! (Definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people)The bartender was great with a positive attitude, although I didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up. They have great Mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and "bloody marias" so I'll def have to order those next time.They give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too! But the star is DEFINITELY the CHILAQUILES. It immediately pulled at my heartstrings as a Californian and is undoubtedly one of my favorite brunch foods.The chips were crispy, evenly and fully coated with the sauce and the eggs on top were perfect. It didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! I was super full afterwards. My friend on the enchiladas which were also super good. The sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted.I feel like we waited for our food for a while...maybe like 25 minutes or so but I think they were a bit backed up so it's understandable!I definitely recommend coming here if you're tired of the standard egg benedict/mimosa brunch.
This is a real hole in the wall place! I met up with a friend visiting from London and our significant others. After a major delay on the f train, I was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door. Probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time. The drinks were delicious and I did like the Frida kalo mug. After the other two arrived (both, like me, via the slow moving f train) we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style. This gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer. Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche (which was extremely fresh) and the queso (which got pretty messy)which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table. I also enjoyed the fish tacos. I really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal. Our server was also so sweet!! This place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant. I would 100% come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu!
Good food. Very busy on a Saturday.Service can be spotty if you sit at the bar to eat. Couple that came in after me ordered were served, ate and left before I got my food.
The hubby, my nephew and I stopped on during happy hour. We sat at the bar, which is always fun. More space too! We each had the chicken tacos, which were amazing! The hubby had a beer. Service was great, as last time.
Cute spot with delicious food! Came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed. Although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar. We started with the guac (just do it!) and then got Chile Relleno and tacos. Service was great and everyone was friendly. Definitely all good vibes.Despite it being a tiny place, we were never ignored or left hanging. If you're on the LES and craving Mexican food, please make a stop here.
This is such a cute and small spot to grab great Mexican food in the LES! I stopped by for early dinner on a Sunday with a friend which also happened to be happy hour which was great! We ordered the fish tacos, queso and a side of rice & beans. I wouldn't suggest the queso but the fish tacos were AMAZING! I could definitely see myself coming back again!
This place is super small, think living room sized, but it's very cute and colorful and has a nicely stocked bar. Excellent cocktails and amazing food selections.
Super fun small loud bar on the LES. Great happy hour and margaritas.
HH menu is great. concise and good portions. Shrimp slider was really good. Margaritas small but good. smaller space but not cramped - sat at booth at bar.
The food and drinks here aren't too bad. The staff is charming, but not as attentive as they could be. But the place is the size of a shoebox and isn't comfortable imho. If I go back, I would go on a slow day. I like to eat and be able to move around, not contract my limbs whilst doing so.
