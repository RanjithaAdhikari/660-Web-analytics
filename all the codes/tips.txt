this is a great spot 
it's a super tiny restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation if you can! the happy hour is amazing! i believe it's from 5 7p weekdays, and it includes drinks and food  $8 margaritas and $8 for 2 chicken tacos, for example   the full hh menu is on their website  
things i have gotten and loved include the margarita and the mayan cocktails, the short rib tacos, chicken tacos, and of course guacamole   chips 
come on in! i came here for brunch   i loved this little place! seats only 14 people and it was a cute whole in the wall vibe 
 
 
a quick vacation to mexico?ambience: 5 star   restaurant is decorated in mexican flag colors and mexican artifacts 
there's a 4 person outdoor patio and a bar and table area 
food: 4 star   loved the guacamole and the chilaquiles 
guacamole was a bit too citrusy for my taste but my bf loved it 
 
be warned! it wasn't the best mexican food i've had but it was still delicious 
drinks: 3 star   i had the bloody maria   strong! tequila flavor was a bit too strong for my taste 
service: 5 star   very sweet ladies who were extremely excited when i spoke in spanish!if you want to feel like you're on vacation, go to la contenta! so it's a saturday early evening and my friend messages me asking if i wanted to go for happy hour 
in my head i think,  happy hour? on a saturday night? no such thing 
  and then she affirms me that there is, from 4 6 
but surprise, we made it  we were on the lower east side  
pros:food wise  based on the happy hour menu where everything, food and drinks, is roughly $8 : my friend is a pescatarian so the menu is very catering to everyone  not much of the happy hour menu is meat based  
recommend: fish tacos, nachos, and torta 
fish tacos were massive too   almost a little too big for the shell but i was not complaining 
nachos were quality where every chip has a little bit on it 
torta: so good that 3 hours later my friend is still raving about it 
it's a bit small  did the math and you can maybe seat 30 people total including the outside  
the servers are attentive and friendly as well 
tldr: if you're looking for a happy hour on a saturday and some quality mexican food, i recommend going here! p 
yes, there is free chips and salsa delicious food 
try the shrimp torta   it's incredible and a little different to your standard mexican place 
the essex cocktail is nice and potent 
the mayan and beer cocktails also great 
bar tender was accommodating and lovely 
we had the shrimp torta and queso   both delectable 
wasn't too busy 5 
cute atmosphere and a group celebrating a bday, all round good find and experience this place is les's not so secret mexican joint 
a small, unassuming restaurant from the outside, la contenta has much more to offer than it looks 
from fish tacos to gambas al ajillo, margarita to mirosa, la contenta carries a simple menu that aims satisfy all of its clientele  unless you're vegetarian i suppose, but then why would you dine at a mexican joint  
it is even approved by my latina amiga   a real mexican would enjoy my carne asada   
aside from the delicious food, la contenta remains one of the very few restaurants that still charges a reasonable price  $13 for all brunch plates and $7 for cocktail  in the gentrifying neighborhood 
what is there not to like   good food, good vibe, and good people 
went here for a happy hour on saturday 
it is a small place but the ambience was lovely and very welcoming 
they were all relatively strong but also tasty at the same time 
the service was perfect and our bartender was vibrant and was always ready to refill our drinks if we needed it 
would definitely recommend that you come here if you are in the area and are looking for a happy hour or trying to burn some time 
the service is exquisite,very fast and precise what you order 
enchiladas were very good and spicy as it should be,drinks,in this case cocktails were formidable exotic tasting,like being in cancun 
sometimes you must have done seriously right in life to be blessed with such good food places around you !! la contenta is one such cute place !! i totally totally love this place ! went for a brunch on saturday afternoon at 12:30 pm and so lucky we got a spot immediately !! tiny little super cute restaurant which can host people upto 9 tables !! i believe people wait a lot here before they get a spot but u see that's what yummy places do to you !!!one of the best ever brunches and mexican food i ve ever had !!! so bloody good food !!! totally loved it ! anything on the brunch menu is $13 and drinks are $7 !! the staff is so sweet !! we got sangrias and camarones al ajillo and chilaquiles with eggs  sunny side up  !! highly recommend these so very yummy !!! and ended it with tres leches which was great !! please do not miss this place must must try !! i'm going back again !! la contenta please open up a restaurant at dc area ! i miss your food this review is not based on their food, it's mainly on the service and the drinks 
after brunch at a different place, i went here for some drinks  yes, daytime drinking!  with my husband and 3 friends 
the place was very small and we sat outside  they have one table outside that fits about 5 people  
it was packed and crowded inside the restaurant and it didn't seem like they take big parties because of the size of the place 
we ordered some drinks  mirosa, sangria, mojito and the mayan , i was not a fan of the mirosa but i took sips of the other drinks and they were delicious 
white sangria was delicious but pretty strong for day time drinking lol 
the waitress brought out chips and a salsa kinda dip and it was very good but they gave us very little chips and we had to keep asking for more 
we also ordered one dish to munch on, the chilaquiles, so yummy 
it was chips with chicken and eggs and  oaxaca  cheese and sauce, the whole thing was so good! it just melted in your mouth 
even though we didn't order food, it didn't diminish the kind of service and attention we got 
every one was kind and friendly 
our waitress, heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable 
wonderful experience 
great attentive service 
narrow room that lends out to an open al fresco front, located on a semi secluded side street spot 
i would try again but not getting the 4 5 star reviews 
perhaps a slow weekday off peak hour had something to do with it 
a cozy, boozy spot for brunch!  definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people the bartender was great with a positive attitude, although i didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up 
they have great mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and  bloody marias  so i'll def have to order those next time 
they give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too! but the star is definitely the chilaquiles 
it immediately pulled at my heartstrings as a californian and is undoubtedly one of my favorite brunch foods 
the chips were crispy, evenly and fully coated with the sauce and the eggs on top were perfect 
it didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! i was super full afterwards 
my friend on the enchiladas which were also super good 
the sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted 
 
 
this is a real hole in the wall place! i met up with a friend visiting from london and our significant others 
after a major delay on the f train, i was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door 
probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time 
the drinks were delicious and i did like the frida kalo mug 
after the other two arrived  both, like me, via the slow moving f train  we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style 
this gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer 
everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche  which was extremely fresh  and the queso  which got pretty messy which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table 
i also enjoyed the fish tacos 
i really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal 
our server was also so sweet!! this place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant 
i would 100  come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu! good food 
very busy on a saturday 
service can be spotty if you sit at the bar to eat 
couple that came in after me ordered were served, ate and left before i got my food 
the hubby, my nephew and i stopped on during happy hour 
more space too! we each had the chicken tacos, which were amazing! the hubby had a beer 
service was great, as last time 
cute spot with delicious food! came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed 
although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar 
we started with the guac  just do it!  and then got chile relleno and tacos 
service was great and everyone was friendly 
definitely all good vibes 
this is such a cute and small spot to grab great mexican food in the les! i stopped by for early dinner on a sunday with a friend which also happened to be happy hour which was great! we ordered the fish tacos, queso and a side of rice & beans 
i wouldn't suggest the queso but the fish tacos were amazing! i could definitely see myself coming back again! this place is super small, think living room sized, but it's very cute and colorful and has a nicely stocked bar 
excellent cocktails and amazing food selections 
super fun small loud bar on the les 
great happy hour and margaritas 
hh menu is great 
concise and good portions 
shrimp slider was really good 
margaritas small but good 
smaller space but not cramped   sat at booth at bar 
the food and drinks here aren't too bad 
the staff is charming, but not as attentive as they could be 
if i go back, i would go on a slow day 
i like to eat and be able to move around, not contract my limbs whilst doing so 
this is a great spot

it's a bit small  did the math and you can maybe seat 30 people total including the outside  
the servers are attentive and friendly as well 
tldr: if you're looking for a happy hour on a saturday and some quality mexican food, i recommend going here! p 
yes, there is free chips and salsa delicious food 
try the shrimp torta   it's incredible and a little different to your standard mexican place 
the essex cocktail is nice and potent 
the mayan and beer cocktails also great 
bar tender was accommodating and lovely 
we had the shrimp torta and queso   both delectable 
wasn't too busy 5 
cute atmosphere and a group celebrating a bday, all round good find and experience this place is les's not so secret mexican joint 
a small, unassuming restaurant from the outside, la contenta has much more to offer than it looks 
from fish tacos to gambas al ajillo, margarita to mirosa, la contenta carries a simple menu that aims satisfy all of its clientele  unless you're vegetarian i suppose, but then why would you dine at a mexican joint  
it is even approved by my latina amiga   a real mexican would enjoy my carne asada   
aside from the delicious food, la contenta remains one of the very few restaurants that still charges a reasonable price  $13 for all brunch plates and $7 for cocktail  in the gentrifying neighborhood 
what is there not to like   good food, good vibe, and good people 
went here for a happy hour on saturday 
it is a small place but the ambience was lovely and very welcoming 
they were all relatively strong but also tasty at the same time 
the service was perfect and our bartender was vibrant and was always ready to refill our drinks if we needed it 
would definitely recommend that you come here if you are in the area and are looking for a happy hour or trying to burn some time 
the service is exquisite,very fast and precise what you order 
enchiladas were very good and spicy as it should be,drinks,in this case cocktails were formidable exotic tasting,like being in cancun 
sometimes you must have done seriously right in life to be blessed with such good food places around you !! la contenta is one such cute place !! i totally totally love this place ! went for a brunch on saturday afternoon at 12:30 pm and so lucky we got a spot immediately !! tiny little super cute restaurant which can host people upto 9 tables !! i believe people wait a lot here before they get a spot but u see that's what yummy places do to you !!!one of the best ever brunches and mexican food i ve ever had !!! so bloody good food !!! totally loved it ! anything on the brunch menu is $13 and drinks are $7 !! the staff is so sweet !! we got sangrias and camarones al ajillo and chilaquiles with eggs  sunny side up  !! highly recommend these so very yummy !!! and ended it with tres leches which was great !! please do not miss this place must must try !! i'm going back again !! la contenta please open up a restaurant at dc area ! i miss your food this review is not based on their food, it's mainly on the service and the drinks 
after brunch at a different place, i went here for some drinks  yes, daytime drinking!  with my husband and 3 friends 
the place was very small and we sat outside  they have one table outside that fits about 5 people  
it was packed and crowded inside the restaurant and it didn't seem like they take big parties because of the size of the place 
we ordered some drinks  mirosa, sangria, mojito and the mayan , i was not a fan of the mirosa but i took sips of the other drinks and they were delicious 
white sangria was delicious but pretty strong for day time drinking lol 
the waitress brought out chips and a salsa kinda dip and it was very good but they gave us very little chips and we had to keep asking for more 
we also ordered one dish to munch on, the chilaquiles, so yummy 
it was chips with chicken and eggs and  oaxaca  cheese and sauce, the whole thing was so good! it just melted in your mouth 
even though we didn't order food, it didn't diminish the kind of service and attention we got 
every one was kind and friendly 
our waitress, heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable 
wonderful experience 
great attentive service 
narrow room that lends out to an open al fresco front, located on a semi secluded side street spot 
i would try again but not getting the 4 5 star reviews 
perhaps a slow weekday off peak hour had something to do with it 
a cozy, boozy spot for brunch!  definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people the bartender was great with a positive attitude, although i didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up 
they have great mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and  bloody marias  so i'll def have to order those next time 
they give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too! but the star is definitely the chilaquiles 
it immediately pulled at my heartstrings as a californian and is undoubtedly one of my favorite brunch foods 
the chips were crispy, evenly and fully coated with the sauce and the eggs on top were perfect 
it didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! i was super full afterwards 
my friend on the enchiladas which were also super good 
the sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted 
 
 
this is a real hole in the wall place! i met up with a friend visiting from london and our significant others 
after a major delay on the f train, i was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door 
probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time 
the drinks were delicious and i did like the frida kalo mug 
after the other two arrived  both, like me, via the slow moving f train  we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style 
this gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer 
everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche  which was extremely fresh  and the queso  which got pretty messy which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table 
i also enjoyed the fish tacos 
i really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal 
our server was also so sweet!! this place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant 
i would 100  come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu! good food 
very busy on a saturday 
service can be spotty if you sit at the bar to eat 
couple that came in after me ordered were served, ate and left before i got my food 
the hubby, my nephew and i stopped on during happy hour 
more space too! we each had the chicken tacos, which were amazing! the hubby had a beer 
service was great, as last time 
cute spot with delicious food! came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed 
although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar 
we started with the guac  just do it!  and then got chile relleno and tacos 
service was great and everyone was friendly 
definitely all good vibes 
this is such a cute and small spot to grab great mexican food in the les! i stopped by for early dinner on a sunday with a friend which also happened to be happy hour which was great! we ordered the fish tacos, queso and a side of rice & beans 
i wouldn't suggest the queso but the fish tacos were amazing! i could definitely see myself coming back again! this place is super small, think living room sized, but it's very cute and colorful and has a nicely stocked bar 
excellent cocktails and amazing food selections 
super fun small loud bar on the les 
great happy hour and margaritas 
hh menu is great 
concise and good portions 
shrimp slider was really good 
margaritas small but good 
smaller space but not cramped   sat at booth at bar 
the food and drinks here aren't too bad 
the staff is charming, but not as attentive as they could be 
if i go back, i would go on a slow day 
i like to eat and be able to move around, not contract my limbs whilst doing so 
this is a great spot 
it's a super tiny restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation if you can! the happy hour is amazing! i believe it's from 5 7p weekdays, and it includes drinks and food  $8 margaritas and $8 for 2 chicken tacos, for example   the full hh menu is on their website  
things i have gotten and loved include the margarita and the mayan cocktails, the short rib tacos, chicken tacos, and of course guacamole   chips 
come on in! i came here for brunch   i loved this little place! seats only 14 people and it was a cute whole in the wall vibe 
 
 
a quick vacation to mexico?ambience: 5 star   restaurant is decorated in mexican flag colors and mexican artifacts 
there's a 4 person outdoor patio and a bar and table area 
food: 4 star   loved the guacamole and the chilaquiles 
guacamole was a bit too citrusy for my taste but my bf loved it 
 
be warned! it wasn't the best mexican food i've had but it was still delicious 
drinks: 3 star   i had the bloody maria   strong! tequila flavor was a bit too strong for my taste 
service: 5 star   very sweet ladies who were extremely excited when i spoke in spanish!if you want to feel like you're on vacation, go to la contenta! so it's a saturday early evening and my friend messages me asking if i wanted to go for happy hour 
in my head i think,  happy hour? on a saturday night? no such thing 
  and then she affirms me that there is, from 4 6 
but surprise, we made it  we were on the lower east side  
pros:food wise  based on the happy hour menu where everything, food and drinks, is roughly $8 : my friend is a pescatarian so the menu is very catering to everyone  not much of the happy hour menu is meat based  
recommend: fish tacos, nachos, and torta 
fish tacos were massive too   almost a little too big for the shell but i was not complaining 
nachos were quality where every chip has a little bit on it 
torta: so good that 3 hours later my friend is still raving about it 
it's a bit small  did the math and you can maybe seat 30 people total including the outside

sometimes you must have done seriously right in life to be blessed with such good food places around you !! la contenta is one such cute place !! i totally totally love this place ! went for a brunch on saturday afternoon at 12:30 pm and so lucky we got a spot immediately !! tiny little super cute restaurant which can host people upto 9 tables !! i believe people wait a lot here before they get a spot but u see that's what yummy places do to you !!!one of the best ever brunches and mexican food i ve ever had !!! so bloody good food !!! totally loved it ! anything on the brunch menu is $13 and drinks are $7 !! the staff is so sweet !! we got sangrias and camarones al ajillo and chilaquiles with eggs  sunny side up  !! highly recommend these so very yummy !!! and ended it with tres leches which was great !! please do not miss this place must must try !! i'm going back again !! la contenta please open up a restaurant at dc area ! i miss your food this review is not based on their food, it's mainly on the service and the drinks 
after brunch at a different place, i went here for some drinks  yes, daytime drinking!  with my husband and 3 friends 
the place was very small and we sat outside  they have one table outside that fits about 5 people  
it was packed and crowded inside the restaurant and it didn't seem like they take big parties because of the size of the place 
we ordered some drinks  mirosa, sangria, mojito and the mayan , i was not a fan of the mirosa but i took sips of the other drinks and they were delicious 
white sangria was delicious but pretty strong for day time drinking lol 
the waitress brought out chips and a salsa kinda dip and it was very good but they gave us very little chips and we had to keep asking for more 
we also ordered one dish to munch on, the chilaquiles, so yummy 
it was chips with chicken and eggs and  oaxaca  cheese and sauce, the whole thing was so good! it just melted in your mouth 
even though we didn't order food, it didn't diminish the kind of service and attention we got 
every one was kind and friendly 
our waitress, heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable 
wonderful experience 
great attentive service 
narrow room that lends out to an open al fresco front, located on a semi secluded side street spot 
i would try again but not getting the 4 5 star reviews 
perhaps a slow weekday off peak hour had something to do with it 
a cozy, boozy spot for brunch!  definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people the bartender was great with a positive attitude, although i didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up 
they have great mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and  bloody marias  so i'll def have to order those next time 
they give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too! but the star is definitely the chilaquiles 
it immediately pulled at my heartstrings as a californian and is undoubtedly one of my favorite brunch foods 
the chips were crispy, evenly and fully coated with the sauce and the eggs on top were perfect 
it didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! i was super full afterwards 
my friend on the enchiladas which were also super good 
the sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted 
 
 
this is a real hole in the wall place! i met up with a friend visiting from london and our significant others 
after a major delay on the f train, i was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door 
probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time 
the drinks were delicious and i did like the frida kalo mug 
after the other two arrived  both, like me, via the slow moving f train  we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style 
this gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer 
everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche  which was extremely fresh  and the queso  which got pretty messy which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table 
i also enjoyed the fish tacos 
i really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal 
our server was also so sweet!! this place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant 
i would 100  come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu! good food 
very busy on a saturday 
service can be spotty if you sit at the bar to eat 
couple that came in after me ordered were served, ate and left before i got my food 
the hubby, my nephew and i stopped on during happy hour 
more space too! we each had the chicken tacos, which were amazing! the hubby had a beer 
service was great, as last time 
cute spot with delicious food! came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed 
although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar 
we started with the guac  just do it!  and then got chile relleno and tacos 
service was great and everyone was friendly 
definitely all good vibes 
this is such a cute and small spot to grab great mexican food in the les! i stopped by for early dinner on a sunday with a friend which also happened to be happy hour which was great! we ordered the fish tacos, queso and a side of rice & beans 
i wouldn't suggest the queso but the fish tacos were amazing! i could definitely see myself coming back again! this place is super small, think living room sized, but it's very cute and colorful and has a nicely stocked bar 
excellent cocktails and amazing food selections 
super fun small loud bar on the les 
great happy hour and margaritas 
hh menu is great 
concise and good portions 
shrimp slider was really good 
margaritas small but good 
smaller space but not cramped   sat at booth at bar 
the food and drinks here aren't too bad 
the staff is charming, but not as attentive as they could be 
if i go back, i would go on a slow day 
i like to eat and be able to move around, not contract my limbs whilst doing so 
this is a great spot 
it's a super tiny restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation if you can! the happy hour is amazing! i believe it's from 5 7p weekdays, and it includes drinks and food  $8 margaritas and $8 for 2 chicken tacos, for example   the full hh menu is on their website  
things i have gotten and loved include the margarita and the mayan cocktails, the short rib tacos, chicken tacos, and of course guacamole   chips 
come on in! i came here for brunch   i loved this little place! seats only 14 people and it was a cute whole in the wall vibe 
 
 
a quick vacation to mexico?ambience: 5 star   restaurant is decorated in mexican flag colors and mexican artifacts 
there's a 4 person outdoor patio and a bar and table area 
food: 4 star   loved the guacamole and the chilaquiles 
guacamole was a bit too citrusy for my taste but my bf loved it 
 
be warned! it wasn't the best mexican food i've had but it was still delicious 
drinks: 3 star   i had the bloody maria   strong! tequila flavor was a bit too strong for my taste 
service: 5 star   very sweet ladies who were extremely excited when i spoke in spanish!if you want to feel like you're on vacation, go to la contenta! so it's a saturday early evening and my friend messages me asking if i wanted to go for happy hour 
in my head i think,  happy hour? on a saturday night? no such thing 
  and then she affirms me that there is, from 4 6 
but surprise, we made it  we were on the lower east side  
pros:food wise  based on the happy hour menu where everything, food and drinks, is roughly $8 : my friend is a pescatarian so the menu is very catering to everyone  not much of the happy hour menu is meat based  
recommend: fish tacos, nachos, and torta 
fish tacos were massive too   almost a little too big for the shell but i was not complaining 
nachos were quality where every chip has a little bit on it 
torta: so good that 3 hours later my friend is still raving about it 
it's a bit small  did the math and you can maybe seat 30 people total including the outside  
the servers are attentive and friendly as well 
tldr: if you're looking for a happy hour on a saturday and some quality mexican food, i recommend going here! p 
yes, there is free chips and salsa delicious food 
try the shrimp torta   it's incredible and a little different to your standard mexican place 
the essex cocktail is nice and potent 
the mayan and beer cocktails also great 
bar tender was accommodating and lovely 
we had the shrimp torta and queso   both delectable 
wasn't too busy 5 
cute atmosphere and a group celebrating a bday, all round good find and experience this place is les's not so secret mexican joint 
a small, unassuming restaurant from the outside, la contenta has much more to offer than it looks 
from fish tacos to gambas al ajillo, margarita to mirosa, la contenta carries a simple menu that aims satisfy all of its clientele  unless you're vegetarian i suppose, but then why would you dine at a mexican joint  
it is even approved by my latina amiga   a real mexican would enjoy my carne asada   
aside from the delicious food, la contenta remains one of the very few restaurants that still charges a reasonable price  $13 for all brunch plates and $7 for cocktail  in the gentrifying neighborhood 
what is there not to like   good food, good vibe, and good people 
went here for a happy hour on saturday 
it is a small place but the ambience was lovely and very welcoming 
they were all relatively strong but also tasty at the same time 
the service was perfect and our bartender was vibrant and was always ready to refill our drinks if we needed it 
would definitely recommend that you come here if you are in the area and are looking for a happy hour or trying to burn some time 
the service is exquisite,very fast and precise what you order 
enchiladas were very good and spicy as it should be,drinks,in this case cocktails were formidable exotic tasting,like being in cancun

our waitress, heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable 
wonderful experience 
great attentive service 
narrow room that lends out to an open al fresco front, located on a semi secluded side street spot 
i would try again but not getting the 4 5 star reviews 
perhaps a slow weekday off peak hour had something to do with it 
a cozy, boozy spot for brunch!  definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people the bartender was great with a positive attitude, although i didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up 
they have great mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and  bloody marias  so i'll def have to order those next time 
they give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too! but the star is definitely the chilaquiles 
it immediately pulled at my heartstrings as a californian and is undoubtedly one of my favorite brunch foods 
the chips were crispy, evenly and fully coated with the sauce and the eggs on top were perfect 
it didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! i was super full afterwards 
my friend on the enchiladas which were also super good 
the sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted 
 
 
this is a real hole in the wall place! i met up with a friend visiting from london and our significant others 
after a major delay on the f train, i was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door 
probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time 
the drinks were delicious and i did like the frida kalo mug 
after the other two arrived  both, like me, via the slow moving f train  we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style 
this gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer 
everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche  which was extremely fresh  and the queso  which got pretty messy which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table 
i also enjoyed the fish tacos 
i really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal 
our server was also so sweet!! this place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant 
i would 100  come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu! good food 
very busy on a saturday 
service can be spotty if you sit at the bar to eat 
couple that came in after me ordered were served, ate and left before i got my food 
the hubby, my nephew and i stopped on during happy hour 
more space too! we each had the chicken tacos, which were amazing! the hubby had a beer 
service was great, as last time 
cute spot with delicious food! came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed 
although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar 
we started with the guac  just do it!  and then got chile relleno and tacos 
service was great and everyone was friendly 
definitely all good vibes 
this is such a cute and small spot to grab great mexican food in the les! i stopped by for early dinner on a sunday with a friend which also happened to be happy hour which was great! we ordered the fish tacos, queso and a side of rice & beans 
i wouldn't suggest the queso but the fish tacos were amazing! i could definitely see myself coming back again! this place is super small, think living room sized, but it's very cute and colorful and has a nicely stocked bar 
excellent cocktails and amazing food selections 
super fun small loud bar on the les 
great happy hour and margaritas 
hh menu is great 
concise and good portions 
shrimp slider was really good 
margaritas small but good 
smaller space but not cramped   sat at booth at bar 
the food and drinks here aren't too bad 
the staff is charming, but not as attentive as they could be 
if i go back, i would go on a slow day 
i like to eat and be able to move around, not contract my limbs whilst doing so 
this is a great spot 
it's a super tiny restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation if you can! the happy hour is amazing! i believe it's from 5 7p weekdays, and it includes drinks and food  $8 margaritas and $8 for 2 chicken tacos, for example   the full hh menu is on their website  
things i have gotten and loved include the margarita and the mayan cocktails, the short rib tacos, chicken tacos, and of course guacamole   chips 
come on in! i came here for brunch   i loved this little place! seats only 14 people and it was a cute whole in the wall vibe 
 
 
a quick vacation to mexico?ambience: 5 star   restaurant is decorated in mexican flag colors and mexican artifacts 
there's a 4 person outdoor patio and a bar and table area 
food: 4 star   loved the guacamole and the chilaquiles 
guacamole was a bit too citrusy for my taste but my bf loved it 
 
be warned! it wasn't the best mexican food i've had but it was still delicious 
drinks: 3 star   i had the bloody maria   strong! tequila flavor was a bit too strong for my taste 
service: 5 star   very sweet ladies who were extremely excited when i spoke in spanish!if you want to feel like you're on vacation, go to la contenta! so it's a saturday early evening and my friend messages me asking if i wanted to go for happy hour 
in my head i think,  happy hour? on a saturday night? no such thing 
  and then she affirms me that there is, from 4 6 
but surprise, we made it  we were on the lower east side  
pros:food wise  based on the happy hour menu where everything, food and drinks, is roughly $8 : my friend is a pescatarian so the menu is very catering to everyone  not much of the happy hour menu is meat based  
recommend: fish tacos, nachos, and torta 
fish tacos were massive too   almost a little too big for the shell but i was not complaining 
nachos were quality where every chip has a little bit on it 
torta: so good that 3 hours later my friend is still raving about it 
it's a bit small  did the math and you can maybe seat 30 people total including the outside  
the servers are attentive and friendly as well 
tldr: if you're looking for a happy hour on a saturday and some quality mexican food, i recommend going here! p 
yes, there is free chips and salsa delicious food 
try the shrimp torta   it's incredible and a little different to your standard mexican place 
the essex cocktail is nice and potent 
the mayan and beer cocktails also great 
bar tender was accommodating and lovely 
we had the shrimp torta and queso   both delectable 
wasn't too busy 5 
cute atmosphere and a group celebrating a bday, all round good find and experience this place is les's not so secret mexican joint 
a small, unassuming restaurant from the outside, la contenta has much more to offer than it looks 
from fish tacos to gambas al ajillo, margarita to mirosa, la contenta carries a simple menu that aims satisfy all of its clientele  unless you're vegetarian i suppose, but then why would you dine at a mexican joint  
it is even approved by my latina amiga   a real mexican would enjoy my carne asada   
aside from the delicious food, la contenta remains one of the very few restaurants that still charges a reasonable price  $13 for all brunch plates and $7 for cocktail  in the gentrifying neighborhood 
what is there not to like   good food, good vibe, and good people 
went here for a happy hour on saturday 
it is a small place but the ambience was lovely and very welcoming 
they were all relatively strong but also tasty at the same time 
the service was perfect and our bartender was vibrant and was always ready to refill our drinks if we needed it 
would definitely recommend that you come here if you are in the area and are looking for a happy hour or trying to burn some time 
the service is exquisite,very fast and precise what you order 
enchiladas were very good and spicy as it should be,drinks,in this case cocktails were formidable exotic tasting,like being in cancun 
sometimes you must have done seriously right in life to be blessed with such good food places around you !! la contenta is one such cute place !! i totally totally love this place ! went for a brunch on saturday afternoon at 12:30 pm and so lucky we got a spot immediately !! tiny little super cute restaurant which can host people upto 9 tables !! i believe people wait a lot here before they get a spot but u see that's what yummy places do to you !!!one of the best ever brunches and mexican food i ve ever had !!! so bloody good food !!! totally loved it ! anything on the brunch menu is $13 and drinks are $7 !! the staff is so sweet !! we got sangrias and camarones al ajillo and chilaquiles with eggs  sunny side up  !! highly recommend these so very yummy !!! and ended it with tres leches which was great !! please do not miss this place must must try !! i'm going back again !! la contenta please open up a restaurant at dc area ! i miss your food this review is not based on their food, it's mainly on the service and the drinks 
after brunch at a different place, i went here for some drinks  yes, daytime drinking!  with my husband and 3 friends 
the place was very small and we sat outside  they have one table outside that fits about 5 people  
it was packed and crowded inside the restaurant and it didn't seem like they take big parties because of the size of the place 
we ordered some drinks  mirosa, sangria, mojito and the mayan , i was not a fan of the mirosa but i took sips of the other drinks and they were delicious 
white sangria was delicious but pretty strong for day time drinking lol 
the waitress brought out chips and a salsa kinda dip and it was very good but they gave us very little chips and we had to keep asking for more 
we also ordered one dish to munch on, the chilaquiles, so yummy 
it was chips with chicken and eggs and  oaxaca  cheese and sauce, the whole thing was so good! it just melted in your mouth 
even though we didn't order food, it didn't diminish the kind of service and attention we got 
every one was kind and friendly 
our waitress, heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable

i really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal 
our server was also so sweet!! this place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant 
i would 100  come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu! good food 
very busy on a saturday 
service can be spotty if you sit at the bar to eat 
couple that came in after me ordered were served, ate and left before i got my food 
the hubby, my nephew and i stopped on during happy hour 
more space too! we each had the chicken tacos, which were amazing! the hubby had a beer 
service was great, as last time 
cute spot with delicious food! came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed 
although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar 
we started with the guac  just do it!  and then got chile relleno and tacos 
service was great and everyone was friendly 
definitely all good vibes 
this is such a cute and small spot to grab great mexican food in the les! i stopped by for early dinner on a sunday with a friend which also happened to be happy hour which was great! we ordered the fish tacos, queso and a side of rice & beans 
i wouldn't suggest the queso but the fish tacos were amazing! i could definitely see myself coming back again! this place is super small, think living room sized, but it's very cute and colorful and has a nicely stocked bar 
excellent cocktails and amazing food selections 
super fun small loud bar on the les 
great happy hour and margaritas 
hh menu is great 
concise and good portions 
shrimp slider was really good 
margaritas small but good 
smaller space but not cramped   sat at booth at bar 
the food and drinks here aren't too bad 
the staff is charming, but not as attentive as they could be 
if i go back, i would go on a slow day 
i like to eat and be able to move around, not contract my limbs whilst doing so 
this is a great spot 
it's a super tiny restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation if you can! the happy hour is amazing! i believe it's from 5 7p weekdays, and it includes drinks and food  $8 margaritas and $8 for 2 chicken tacos, for example   the full hh menu is on their website  
things i have gotten and loved include the margarita and the mayan cocktails, the short rib tacos, chicken tacos, and of course guacamole   chips 
come on in! i came here for brunch   i loved this little place! seats only 14 people and it was a cute whole in the wall vibe 
 
 
a quick vacation to mexico?ambience: 5 star   restaurant is decorated in mexican flag colors and mexican artifacts 
there's a 4 person outdoor patio and a bar and table area 
food: 4 star   loved the guacamole and the chilaquiles 
guacamole was a bit too citrusy for my taste but my bf loved it 
 
be warned! it wasn't the best mexican food i've had but it was still delicious 
drinks: 3 star   i had the bloody maria   strong! tequila flavor was a bit too strong for my taste 
service: 5 star   very sweet ladies who were extremely excited when i spoke in spanish!if you want to feel like you're on vacation, go to la contenta! so it's a saturday early evening and my friend messages me asking if i wanted to go for happy hour 
in my head i think,  happy hour? on a saturday night? no such thing 
  and then she affirms me that there is, from 4 6 
but surprise, we made it  we were on the lower east side  
pros:food wise  based on the happy hour menu where everything, food and drinks, is roughly $8 : my friend is a pescatarian so the menu is very catering to everyone  not much of the happy hour menu is meat based  
recommend: fish tacos, nachos, and torta 
fish tacos were massive too   almost a little too big for the shell but i was not complaining 
nachos were quality where every chip has a little bit on it 
torta: so good that 3 hours later my friend is still raving about it 
it's a bit small  did the math and you can maybe seat 30 people total including the outside  
the servers are attentive and friendly as well 
tldr: if you're looking for a happy hour on a saturday and some quality mexican food, i recommend going here! p 
yes, there is free chips and salsa delicious food 
try the shrimp torta   it's incredible and a little different to your standard mexican place 
the essex cocktail is nice and potent 
the mayan and beer cocktails also great 
bar tender was accommodating and lovely 
we had the shrimp torta and queso   both delectable 
wasn't too busy 5 
cute atmosphere and a group celebrating a bday, all round good find and experience this place is les's not so secret mexican joint 
a small, unassuming restaurant from the outside, la contenta has much more to offer than it looks 
from fish tacos to gambas al ajillo, margarita to mirosa, la contenta carries a simple menu that aims satisfy all of its clientele  unless you're vegetarian i suppose, but then why would you dine at a mexican joint  
it is even approved by my latina amiga   a real mexican would enjoy my carne asada   
aside from the delicious food, la contenta remains one of the very few restaurants that still charges a reasonable price  $13 for all brunch plates and $7 for cocktail  in the gentrifying neighborhood 
what is there not to like   good food, good vibe, and good people 
went here for a happy hour on saturday 
it is a small place but the ambience was lovely and very welcoming 
they were all relatively strong but also tasty at the same time 
the service was perfect and our bartender was vibrant and was always ready to refill our drinks if we needed it 
would definitely recommend that you come here if you are in the area and are looking for a happy hour or trying to burn some time 
the service is exquisite,very fast and precise what you order 
enchiladas were very good and spicy as it should be,drinks,in this case cocktails were formidable exotic tasting,like being in cancun 
sometimes you must have done seriously right in life to be blessed with such good food places around you !! la contenta is one such cute place !! i totally totally love this place ! went for a brunch on saturday afternoon at 12:30 pm and so lucky we got a spot immediately !! tiny little super cute restaurant which can host people upto 9 tables !! i believe people wait a lot here before they get a spot but u see that's what yummy places do to you !!!one of the best ever brunches and mexican food i ve ever had !!! so bloody good food !!! totally loved it ! anything on the brunch menu is $13 and drinks are $7 !! the staff is so sweet !! we got sangrias and camarones al ajillo and chilaquiles with eggs  sunny side up  !! highly recommend these so very yummy !!! and ended it with tres leches which was great !! please do not miss this place must must try !! i'm going back again !! la contenta please open up a restaurant at dc area ! i miss your food this review is not based on their food, it's mainly on the service and the drinks 
after brunch at a different place, i went here for some drinks  yes, daytime drinking!  with my husband and 3 friends 
the place was very small and we sat outside  they have one table outside that fits about 5 people  
it was packed and crowded inside the restaurant and it didn't seem like they take big parties because of the size of the place 
we ordered some drinks  mirosa, sangria, mojito and the mayan , i was not a fan of the mirosa but i took sips of the other drinks and they were delicious 
white sangria was delicious but pretty strong for day time drinking lol 
the waitress brought out chips and a salsa kinda dip and it was very good but they gave us very little chips and we had to keep asking for more 
we also ordered one dish to munch on, the chilaquiles, so yummy 
it was chips with chicken and eggs and  oaxaca  cheese and sauce, the whole thing was so good! it just melted in your mouth 
even though we didn't order food, it didn't diminish the kind of service and attention we got 
every one was kind and friendly 
our waitress, heidi, she was sweet, attentive and kept checking on us and made us feel welcomed and comfortable 
wonderful experience 
great attentive service 
narrow room that lends out to an open al fresco front, located on a semi secluded side street spot 
i would try again but not getting the 4 5 star reviews 
perhaps a slow weekday off peak hour had something to do with it 
a cozy, boozy spot for brunch!  definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people the bartender was great with a positive attitude, although i didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up 
they have great mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and  bloody marias  so i'll def have to order those next time 
they give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too! but the star is definitely the chilaquiles 
it immediately pulled at my heartstrings as a californian and is undoubtedly one of my favorite brunch foods 
the chips were crispy, evenly and fully coated with the sauce and the eggs on top were perfect 
it didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! i was super full afterwards 
my friend on the enchiladas which were also super good 
the sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted 
 
 
this is a real hole in the wall place! i met up with a friend visiting from london and our significant others 
after a major delay on the f train, i was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door 
probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time 
the drinks were delicious and i did like the frida kalo mug 
after the other two arrived  both, like me, via the slow moving f train  we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style 
this gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer 
everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche  which was extremely fresh  and the queso  which got pretty messy which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table
